      Transitioning from sound engineering into web development, my passion for coding is as deep as my roots in music. After enrolling into a web development training at OpenClassroom and an intensive bootcamp at 42 School, I became really interested in solving complex problems and developing scalable solutions. Since then, I keep enhancing my skills through self-directed learning, exploring new technologies, and applying what I learn to practical projects.

      <p>
      Continuously driven by curiosity, I thrive on learning new things, pushing my limits, and sharing my excitement for technology with others. I'm actively seeking a full-time Developer role where I can contribute meaningfully while expanding my knowledge and skills.

      Off the keyboard, I enjoy producing music and gamingâ€”a blend of creativity and challenge.

      Eager to bring my motivation and my hardworking nature to your team!
